## 1. Manipulate and Visualize Data in Jupyter  
Gain hands-on experience working with real-world datasets. In this module, you'll:  
- Use **Pandas** to clean, preprocess, and analyze data.  
- Create informative and visually appealing plots with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn.**  
- Draw insights from data and explore trends through visual storytelling.

Key Files:  
- `data_visualization.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with data manipulation and visualization workflows.

## 2. Perform Sentiment Analysis  
Explore the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) by analyzing text data. In this module, you'll:  
- Use the **NLTK** library to preprocess and tokenize text.  
- Leverage **VADER Sentiment Analyzer** to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.  
- Apply sentiment analysis to social media data, product reviews, or customer feedback.  

Key Files:  
- `sentiment_analysis.py` – Python script implementing sentiment analysis workflows.

## 3. Work with Image Recognition  
Incorporate image recognition into an application by working with **OpenCV** and pre-trained models. In this module, you'll:  
- Detect faces in images using **Haar cascades.**  
- Process images to enhance their quality and prepare them for machine learning tasks.  
- Explore real-world applications of image recognition in projects like facial detection and object classification.  

Key Files:  
- `face_detection.py` – Python script for face detection using OpenCV.  
- `group-photo.webp` – Sample image used for image recognition tasks.

## 4. Scrape Data from the Internet  
Learn how to gather data directly from websites using web scraping techniques. In this module, you'll:  
- Use **BeautifulSoup** to parse HTML and extract meaningful information.  
- Automate the process of collecting data from multiple web pages.  
- Apply web scraping for applications like building datasets and extracting real-time information.  

Key Files:  
- `web_scraping.py` – Python script for web scraping with BeautifulSoup.
